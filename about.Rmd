**I apply research, data, and experience to answer questions about effective leadership and teamwork in the workplace.** 
</center>
I have a PhD in Social/Personality Psychology, specializing in conflict and cooperation. My primary research is on when and why people might trust and distrust the same person, and I leverage this understanding to identify areas of potential improvement in the way people work together. 

Prior to my academic career I served honorably in the U.S. military. During my military career, I was awarded the Joint Service Commendation Medal and the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal (among others) for my leadership and teamwork behaviors. Consequently, I know *what* supports effective teamwork and leadership and *how* to implement those systems.

# People Work 
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.height = '70%', out.width = '70%', fig.align = 'left'}

Everybody has had to engage in "People Work" at some point in their lives. Maybe the boss got in the way, or maybe your subordinates didn't do their work. Whenever you have to strategize about how to deal with someone else instead of being able to focus on your job, you are engaging in People Work. 

People Work is exhausting. It is emotionally and psychologically draining to constantly be thinking about how you will respond when So-And-So stabs you in the back or when What’s-Their-Face fails to do the bare minimum again and you have to pick up their slack. I can help you eliminate the People Work.

# My Philosophy

I believe that companies can get the most out of their people when their people love what they do. When employees are fully engaged in their work, everyone benefits. Companies benefit because they get more for their money, and employees benefit because they can trust that their teammates will pull their weight. By applying the latest research on interpersonal trust, I help teams be more effective by reducing the amount of time your employees engage in People Work.

I built this entire website in the R programming language. Every page was created separately and compiled by RMarkdown and Github Pages. On all of the pages where I cover data manipulation, visualizations, or analyses, I make my code available so you can walk through my examples. 

If you would like me to add something, or if you notice an error on any of these pages (or if you just want to chat!), please email me at timothy dot carsel at gmail dot com. You can also click on the links on the top right-hand side of each page for my resume, email, LinkedIn, or Twitter.

I hope you find these resources helpful, and thank you for stopping by!
